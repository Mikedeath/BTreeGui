# BTreeGui
a Qt GUI to display B Tree,which supports adding and deleting nodes. 
i just build the project with msvc,without testing if it work well with gcc or mingw.
i think this can  help the beginner to learn how a B Tree is created and tranformed.
i do it just because i do not find any projects link it online.
i am just a student and new to Qt,excuse some ugly codes.
